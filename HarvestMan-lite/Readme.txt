This is an attempt to create a light-weight HarvestMan
from the existing source code by removing unused modules,
test files, unwanted/old source code. 

Apart from module change, the source code will be
cleaned up to remove older, uselss code and unnecessary
features, including redundant classes/objects etc.

The HarvestMan-lite source code, once completed will replace
the HarvestMan source code and the older HarvestMan source
code will be renamed to HarvestMan.old.

The HarvestMan-lite source code will later form the basis of
a Super harvestman project which will utilize the Multi
threaded HarvestMan program for a multiprocess, multi-
website crawling project.
